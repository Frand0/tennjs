## Beginner JavaScript Project

After reading through No Starch Press's JavaScript Crash Course, this is the first form of of the first project; a pong clone or, tennjs, heh.

I'm following along with the project and taking time to understand the concepts and tools used along the way. I will be making this a pretty much 1:1 clone of the books tutorial to begin with but afterwords will be updating it with my own flavour, styling, etc. 

Using this as a simple project to restablish my learning of JavaScript, sinc eit has been a while, learn some new things along the way and create a first project for my portfolio (website to come soon-ish)

Credit going to No Starch Press and author Nick Morgan obviously.
